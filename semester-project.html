        <h1>semester-project</h1>
        <p>This is my semester-project, a four week project we did after learning about design, Web and Communications
          Technology, HTML & CSS and Project Methodology. We needed to design and program a site for an interactive
          science museum called the Community Science Museum. </p>
        <p>Some of the aspects of the brief: "An interactive science
          museum called the Community Science Museum is opening in your town/city. Its core target audience is primary
          and middle school children (7-15) and families with young children. The museum wants a website that is
          informative and appealing, that will attract both middle school pupils and their parents."</p>

      <h3>Site updates</h3>
      <p>What changes have I made to my site and why I decided to make them:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Some of the feedback I got on this site was that "the banner image is pixelating on larger screens. Also,
          maybe a calmer
          image might be a bit more engaging and in line with the rest of the site." I decided to change the image and
          image size to make it work better both in line with the rest of the sites design and to make it work better
          on larger screen sizes. Want to thank MJ Phillip for help with resizing the image to work for bigger screen
          sizes.</li>
        <li> Another feedback I got on this page was that it "would be best if image sizes (as you have for the logo)
          were set
          in CSS rather than HTML." I have removed the image sizing for the logo in HTML and styled it in CSS.</li>
        <li>I have added form validation to the contact form to make it easier for the user to fill it out correct.</li>
        <li>I have made a shopping cart function to make the site more user friendly. Users can now add products to the
          shopping cart and get the
          total price and proceed to the checkout page.</li>
        <li>I have addet form validation to the payment form to make this process easy and effective for the users.</li>
